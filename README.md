For our Milestone 2 project we had two tasks, supervised learning and unsupervised learning analysis. We decided to try to do next-day price prediction for the supervised learning part because it was a simpler goal for us to understand. For the unsupervised learning part of the project, we wanted to see if we could find families of coins whose prices tend to move together. This was accomplished by finding similar price movement through dynamic time warping and clustering, with the result being quite reasonable.

For data collection, we used Coinmetrics and LunarCrush, which cover over a thousand cryptocurrencies providing real-time, daily & weekly updates and historical data, regarding market volume, market capitalization, transactions, coins in wallet, social media data, etc. Coinmetrics archives cryptocurrencies since January 2010, meaning data are available almost from creation for almost all existing coins. LunarCrush makes available the last two years worth of data, mostly having to do with social media. Both Coinmetrics and LunarCrush provide free APIs that facilitate historical data downloading.
